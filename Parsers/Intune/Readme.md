# Technical Summary: Integrating Microsoft Intune Logs with a 3rd Party SIEM for Alert Notifications

## Introduction

This document provides a technical summary of how to utilize Microsoft Intune logs with Azure Monitor and subsequently feed the data into a third-party Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for generating alert notifications. The integration aims to enhance security monitoring and incident response by leveraging Intune log analytics within your broader security ecosystem.

### Overview of Microsoft Intune Log Capabilities

Microsoft Intune provides extensive logging capabilities through its integration with Azure Monitor. These logs include:

- Device compliance and configuration logs.
- Application management logs.
- Device enrollment and lifecycle logs.
- Audit logs for administrative activities.

These logs are invaluable for understanding the state of your devices, configurations, and user activities within the Intune-managed environment.

#### Azure Monitor Log Integration

Azure Monitor acts as the primary aggregation point for Intune logs. Key features include:

1. **Log Analytics Workspaces:** Logs from Intune can be routed to a Log Analytics Workspace where advanced queries and analytics can be performed.
2. **Diagnostic Settings:** Diagnostic settings in Intune allow you to specify which logs to send to Azure Monitor.
3. **Alert Rules:** Azure Monitor can generate alerts based on custom-defined rules that analyze incoming log data.

#### Steps to Enable Log Collection in Azure Monitor

1. **Create or Identify a Log Analytics Workspace:** Ensure a Log Analytics Workspace is available in your Azure environment.
2. **Configure Diagnostic Settings in Intune:**
   - Navigate to the Intune portal within the Azure portal.
   - Go to **Diagnostic settings** and select the logs to send (e.g., AuditLogs, SignInLogs, OperationalLogs).
   - Specify the target Log Analytics Workspace.
3. **Verify Log Ingestion:** Use the Log Analytics query editor to validate that logs are flowing into the workspace.

#### Feeding Logs into a Third-Party SIEM

Once Intune logs are ingested into Azure Monitor, they can be forwarded to a third-party SIEM system using the following methods:

1. **Azure Monitor Data Export:**

   - Use the Data Export feature to stream logs directly from the Log Analytics Workspace to an external destination.
   - Configure an Event Hub to act as a bridge for sending data to the SIEM.

2. **Custom Export Using Logic Apps or Azure Functions:**

   - Build a custom workflow using Azure Logic Apps to periodically pull data from the Log Analytics Workspace and push it to the SIEM API.

3. **SIEM-Specific Connectors:**

   - Leverage built-in or marketplace connectors for specific SIEM platforms (e.g., Splunk, QRadar) to simplify integration.

#### Key Considerations for Integration

- **Log Format and Parsing:** Ensure the logs sent to the SIEM are in a format compatible with its ingestion engine. Transformation may be required.
- **Retention Policies:** Define data retention policies in both Azure Monitor and the SIEM to avoid unnecessary storage costs.
- **Alert Tuning:** Configure meaningful alert thresholds to minimize false positives.
- **Security and Compliance:** Secure data flows using encryption and role-based access controls.

#### Example Use Case: Compliance Policy Violations

- **Objective:** Alert on non-compliance with device security policies.
- **Steps:**
  1. Define a KQL query in Log Analytics to identify non-compliant devices:
     ```kql
     IntuneCompliancePolicies_CL
     | where Status == "NonCompliant"
     ```
  2. Use Azure Monitor to trigger an alert based on the query result.
  3. Forward the alert details to the SIEM for centralized tracking and notifications.

#### Conclusion

Integrating Microsoft Intune logs with a third-party SIEM system provides a robust mechanism for real-time security monitoring and alerting. By leveraging Azure Monitor as an intermediary, organizations can achieve seamless log ingestion, transformation, and forwarding, ensuring comprehensive visibility into their endpoint security posture.
